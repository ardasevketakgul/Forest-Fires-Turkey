# Forest-Fires-in-Turkey

### Project Overview
In Turkey, forest fires constitute a serious environmental and socioeconomic problem. Large tracts of forest, wildlife, and occasionally human settlements are destroyed as a result. In order to determine the elements that contribute to fire occurrences, this project will analyze historical forest fire data from Turkey from 2010 to 2024. Understanding the effects of environmental and human-related causes and forecasting future forest fires are the objectives.

### Data Collection Plan
The data for this project will be collected from the following publicly available datasets:
- **Tarım ve Orman Bakanlığı**: Data on the locations, time, and size of forest fires in Turkey.
- **Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS)**: Global wildfire data that will allow for comparable evaluation.
- **Meteoroloji Genel Müdürlüğü,OpenWeatherMap etc.**: Meteorological data such as temperature and wind speed, which are important in understanding fire behavior.
- **Additional Enrichment Data**: Data on land use, human settlements, and population density, which will be obtained from GIS datasets.



### Project Approach
The project will follow the data science workflow:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather the necessary data from the mentioned sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data using visualizations and descriptive statistics to identify significant patterns and trends.
4. **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models to predict future fire occurrences based on historical patterns.
5. **Results and Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and propose recommendations for fire prevention strategies.

### Expected Outcomes
- Identification of key factors contributing to forest fires in Turkey.
- Development of a predictive model for future forest fire risk.
- Insights for improving forest fire management and prevention strategies.
